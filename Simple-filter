let num = []
for(let i = 10 ; i <= 100 ; i += 10){
if(i !== 40 ){
    num.push(i)
}
}

console.log(num)

firstly we should  to make a new array from another array by for loop 

1- we make a new array epmty 

2- make an if statement in expression use the main array we take element from it 

3- in breake line we do what we want = > we type the new array and push the i ( the element we want ) push it in new array 

4- dont miss the continue tage to escape the indexes empty in main array 


wo the our function build by new array - for loop in main array - if statement to filter main array - array.push(i) - continue tag to escape the element we dont want it
